// create variables, in this examples, pieces of fruit
var strawberries = 15;
var blueberries = 25;
var bannanas = 7;
// create another variable, that is the sum of the 3 pieces of fruit
var fruit = strawberries + blueberries + bannanas;

// take the variable that is the sum of all items, and divide them by 7, / is the symbol for division
// + for addition, - for subtraction and * for multiplication
var smoothie = fruit / 7;

// would print 6.714285714285714, but lets make it easier to read
// create a new variable and have it equal the variable that is divided by 7 and attach .toFixed(2), so that 2 decimal places appear on the screen
// try this code with other measurements and change how many decimals appear
var s = smoothie.toFixed(2);

// print the sum of all the items you have
document.write(" I have " + fruit + " pieces of fruit");
// create a line break, to make the text easier to read
document.write("<br>");

// it takes 7 pieces of fruit to make a smoothie, print a sentence saying how many smoothies you can make
// use s because that is the variable that is limited to 2 decimal places
// print the new variable with a string
document.write(" and with that much fruit, I can make " + s + " smoothies");
